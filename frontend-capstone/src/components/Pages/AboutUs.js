                            Founders that promote frugality and capital efficiency in their startups get a greater degree of investor interest and appreciation, says Hariharan Premkumar, Head of India of venture capital firm DSG Consumer Partners. In a conversation with About Amazon India ahead of the Amazon Global Selling Propel Accelerator Season 2 finale on September 7 (DSG has partnered with Amazon Global Selling Propel Accelerator for seasons 1 and 2), Premkumar talks about key growth metrics that Indian consumer startups should focus on while discussing some the important things to keep in mind while selling globally. Edited excerpts.

                            For us, the main consideration is evaluating whether a founder has an unfair advantage to build a large business and if he or she is building that business for the right reasons. We like to assess what drives a founder to make his or her business grow. The founders that remain frugal and efficient when it comes to managing capital are appreciated over others. So we are always paying attention to how capital-efficient the founder and the business model is.

                            Product categories that have the potential to grow exponentially:
                            The beauty and personal care segment is the category I see growing exponentially. Brands have scaled up well in the online channel in this industry, whether it’s in India or abroad. At the same time, we have seen brands scaling up across other categories that we've invested in including fashion and consumer durables. So I think there is a significant opportunity for brands to experiment in these industries.
